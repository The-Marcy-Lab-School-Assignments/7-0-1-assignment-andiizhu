# Question

What are the two arguments that `useEffect` accepts?

# Answer

The two arguments that `useEffect` accepts is the setup and dependency array. The setup refers to the function that contains the logic that happens when a side effect occurs. An example of a setup is when sending a fetch request. The dependency array is optional and it is the array of values that the setup function depends on to trigger. If the values that are inside of the dependency array change, then the setup will be triggered. If the dependency array is not present, it will run after every render. If the dependency array is empty `[]`, then the setup function will run once.
